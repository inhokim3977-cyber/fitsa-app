STEP 1 - PRESERVE ORIGINAL:
Copy the person's photo EXACTLY as-is. Do NOT regenerate, redraw, or modify:
- Face: Keep identical
- Hair: Keep identical  
- Body: Keep identical
- Hands: Keep identical
- Books/objects: Keep identical
- Background: Keep identical

STEP 2 - ADD HAT LAYER:
Place ONLY the hat on top of the person's head:
- Hat size: Scale to fit head naturally
- Hat position: Rest on top of head (not floating, not sinking)
- Hat angle: Match head tilt
- Shadows: Add subtle shadow under brim only
- Lighting: Match photo's light direction

STEP 3 - OUTPUT:
Return the original photo with ONLY a hat digitally added on top.
Same dimensions as input. This is a simple overlay - do not alter anything else."""

- Body proportions: IDENTICAL width/height ratio (DO NOT stretch, DO NOT compress)
- Thigh size: IDENTICAL volume (DO NOT thin, DO NOT bulk)
- Calf size: IDENTICAL volume (DO NOT modify)

- Hair: EXACT same
- Arms: EXACT same
- Hands: EXACT same
- Upper body clothing: EXACT same (color, pattern, wrinkles)
- Torso: EXACT same shape

- IF dress is LONG (below knee, maxi dress): Dress covers legs
- ABSOLUTELY NO jeans/pants/leggings visible under dress
